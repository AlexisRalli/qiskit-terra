    The new function `linear_depth_mcv(circuit, x, z, controls, target, ctrl_state)` 
    applies a multi-controlled SU(2) gate [[z*, x],[-x, z]] with x real and z 
    complex. With n-1 controls, the decomposition requires approximately 16n cx gates. 
    Synthesis of mcrx and mcry without auxiliary now uses the `linear_depth_mcv` decomposition.
